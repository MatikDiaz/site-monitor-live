# site-monitor-live
Monitors site content for changes, for example: you are looking for a reply on the forum(works with url.com/ as well as url.com/forum/123/), but the forum doesn't have a notification system, here you can enter url to be monitored and when new reply appears on url you will receive notification bar and voice about it.
you need to install all modules to run a code:

import tkinter
import webbrowser
import requests
import threading
import hashlib
pip install tkinter
pip install webbrowser
pip install requests
pip install threading
pip install hashlib
pip install BeautifulSoup
pip install bs4
pip install datetime
pip install time
pip install winsound
